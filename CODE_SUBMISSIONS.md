# Code Submission Guidelines
We encourage everyone to share their code with the group by contributing solutions to this repo. Please use the following guide to ensure your submissions are counted.

## Code Requirements
There are none! If you want to use a different language per puzzle, it's ok. If you want to use the same executable for both parts of the puzzle, it's ok. If you want to want to make a UI for a puzzle because you think it's cool, it's ok. If you want to code your solutions in CSS or Salesforce Apex or Minecraft automation, you need help but we won't stop you.

We do have one ask but it's a *code organization* ask. Please keep code organized in such as way as to make it obvious which code is for what puzzle. It's helpful if we can look for a file, a directory, or even a class name with something like "Day1" or "Dec1_part1" or "d1-1.js" or any other obvious scheme you come up with to keep your solutions organized by day (and by part 1 and 2 if you choose).

## Repo Structure
In this repo, each participant has a top-level directory with their submissions. The participant directory name should match the participants name on the Advent of Code leaderboard. In each participant directory we expect the following:
- A README.md file describing:
	- The general structure of your submissions ie. one application, individual, etc.
	- What are the requirements to build and run the solutions. *This can be different among days, parts, etc.*
- .gitignore(s) where appropriate so that build artifacts, 3rd party dependencies, etc. are excluded.

1. Fork this repo
2. Push your solution to your fork
3. Submit a PR from your fork to the ```main``` branch of this repo
